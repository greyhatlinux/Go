# Go

A repository to learn Golang from basics, covering each nitty-gritty details about the language. 

There are two types of Go programs: executables and
libraries

1. Executables are the file which can be directly run from the terminal, like the hello-world program we have
2. Libraries are the collection of code we bundle togther so as to use then later in our application. Like we used package "fmt" in our first program. 


* Go mostly doesn't care about whitespace. It is used to make programs more readable.
