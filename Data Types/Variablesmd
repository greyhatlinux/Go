# Variables


* Go is a statically typed programming language. This means, variables always have specific types allocated (Unlike python and JS, where a variable can hold any data type)

* Go comes with several built-in data types

* Go's integer types are: uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64,
int8, int16, int32 and int64.
